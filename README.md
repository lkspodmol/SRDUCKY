# SRDUCKY
Slow Rubber Ducky
Hello!

Ive created a Rubber ducky that slows the computer (potentionally crashes, happens unusually).

I take NO responsibility for your actions with this script, use it only with permissions that you are given.

This script works only on Windows 10 and 11.

THis script reserves RAM and does some calculations to create a load for the CPU.
To stop the slowing script, you need to terminate powershell.exe and after that wscript.exe, or just restart the computer. Powershell.exe is watchdog that restarts it, if it will be terminated. 
After the computer restarts, it starts .bat that will cleanup the files that were droped on the system.
